Now for the fun part.

This code is released into the public domain. Feel free to use / change as you see fit this code or parts of it.

This program is written by a hobbyist to learn / play with Naive Bayes in Python. This is one of my first Python projects.

The algorithm implemented in this project is from section 6.10 in Tom Mitchell's Machine Learning text book.

The algorithm was tested on the IMDB dataset - I downloaded this from the CMU 701 Course page.

The accuracy of the classifier topped at 84% for smoothing factor set to 10.

I hope you find this useful.
